## 🧬 Load Avatars

### Basic Usage

```csharp
var avatar = await PlayerZeroSdk.InstantiateAvatarAsync(new CharacterRequestConfig {
    AvatarId = "AVATAR_ID_HERE"
});
```

### Load With Blueprint

```csharp
var avatar = await PlayerZeroSdk.InstantiateAvatarAsync(new CharacterRequestConfig {
    AvatarId = "AVATAR_ID_HERE",
    BlueprintId = "BLUEPRINT_ID_HERE"
});
```

### Hot Load Example

```csharp
var avatarId = PlayerZeroSdk.GetHotLoadedAvatarId();
var avatar = await PlayerZeroSdk.InstantiateAvatarAsync(new CharacterRequestConfig {
    AvatarId = avatarId,
    BlueprintId = "BLUEPRINT_ID_HERE"
});
```

### Load From Short Code

```csharp
// Assume `inputField` is a Unity UI InputField containing the code
var code = inputField.text;
var avatarId = await PlayerZeroSdk.GetAvatarIdFromCodeAsync(code);
var avatar = await PlayerZeroSdk.InstantiateAvatarAsync(new CharacterRequestConfig {
    AvatarId = avatarId,
    BlueprintId = "BLUEPRINT_ID_HERE"
});
```

### Load 2D Avatar Image

Use `AvatarImageLoader` or `PlayerZeroSdk.GetIconAsync` to display a 2D render of an avatar:

```csharp
AvatarImageConfig options = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<AvatarImageConfig>();
var sprite = await PlayerZeroSdk.GetIconAsync("AVATAR_ID_HERE", options);
image.sprite = sprite;
```

Attach `AvatarImageLoader` to any UI `Image`, configure the parameters in the inspector and set the avatar id to load automatically.


## 🎭 Mesh Transfer

Seamlessly apply a Player Zero avatar's visuals to an existing prefab:

```csharp
var avatar = await PlayerZeroSdk.InstantiateAvatarAsync(new CharacterRequestConfig {
    AvatarId = "AVATAR_ID_HERE",
    BlueprintId = "BLUEPRINT_ID_HERE"
});
new MeshTransfer().Transfer(avatar, existingCharacter);
```

## 📊 Analytics

1. Add the `PlayerZeroAnalytics` component to an empty GameObject in your first scene.
2. Set your **Game ID** in `Tools → Player Zero`.

### Fire a Custom Event

```csharp
PlayerZeroSdk.StartEventSession<GameSessionStartedEvent, GameSessionStartedProperties>(
    new GameSessionStartedEvent {
        Properties = new GameSessionStartedProperties {
            AvatarId = PlayerZeroSdk.GetHotLoadedAvatarId()
        }
    }
);
```
